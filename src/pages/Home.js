      <h1> About me</h1>
      <h3>
        With eight years of experience in the IT industry, I decided to
        transition into Java programming. I gained my initial IT experience
        in Russia as an administrator from 2015 to 2020 in St. Petersburg.
        During this time, I acquired valuable knowledge working with Unix
        systems and developed small applications for various tasks.
      </h3>
      <h3> 
        I further expanded my expertise as a member of the technical staff at
        Oracle, where I contributed to a cloud project by testing networks
        and hard disk drivers. 
        I faced the challenge of working with Python instead of Java and successfully adapted to the new language.
        Additionally, I regularly tested drivers with new kernels on different
        virtual machines. Since the beginning of 2018, I have been actively
        studying backend and frontend development on my own. I have
        completed several courses on the JavaRush and Helsinki University
        platforms, enhancing my skills in these areas. This year, I focused
        on learning Kubernetes and Docker to strengthen my proficiency in
        containerization and orchestration.
        </h3>
        <h3> 
          Currently, I am pursuing the Ultimate AWS Certified Developer
          Associate 2023 NEW DVA-C02 online course on Udemy. You can explore
          my portfolio page, which showcases projects I have developed
          independently. My passion lies in professional growth as a Java
          Developer, both in backend and frontend development, with the
          ultimate goal of becoming an Architect. Drawing from my experience
          as a system administrator, I possess a deep understanding of DevOps
          features and how they can contribute to successful project outcomes.
          I am highly motivated to apply my knowledge in challenging projects
          that not only allow me to learn new technologies but also enhance
          my working experience.
